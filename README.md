## üîß Projects

### BreakSense

A digital brake state monitoring system for ESP32 microcontrollers.

**Features:**
- Wi-Fi and MQTT connectivity with automatic reconnection
- GPIO pin monitoring with software debouncing
- Configurable settings (debounce time, topic, pin)
- Unique client ID based on ESP32 MAC address
- MQTT Last Will and Testament for offline detection

**Technical Details:**
- Monitors a digital brake sensor on a configurable GPIO pin
- Publishes state changes (`HIGH`/`LOW`) to an MQTT topic
- Uses debouncing to prevent false triggers
- Configurable delay, pin, and debug options

### TempSense

A temperature and humidity monitoring system that uses I2C sensors with the ESP32.

**Features:**
- Wi-Fi and MQTT connectivity with automatic reconnection
- I2C sensor integration
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA) data smoothing
- Smart publishing (only when significant changes occur)
- Configurable thresholds and parameters

**Configuration Options:**
- `MQTT_TOPIC` (default: `'esp32/tempsense'`)
- `LOOP_DELAY` (default: `5` seconds)
- `EMA_ALPHA` smoothing factor (default: `0.1`)
- `TEMP_THRESHOLD` (default: `0.3` ¬∞C)
- `HUMIDITY_THRESHOLD` (default: `1.0` %RH)
- I2C pins and frequency settings

**How It Works:**
1. Connects to Wi-Fi and MQTT broker
2. Sets up LWT message for offline detection
3. Reads temperature and humidity from I2C sensor
4. Applies EMA smoothing algorithm to reduce noise
5. Publishes data to MQTT when changes exceed thresholds
6. Automatically reconnects if connections drop

### LightCont

A relay-based light controller system for ESP32 with both MQTT and physical button control.

**Features:**
- Wi-Fi and MQTT connectivity with automatic reconnection
- Support for multiple relay-controlled lights/devices
- Physical momentary switch control with debouncing
- Flexible button-to-relay mapping (control specific lights with buttons)
- Topic-based control for individual relays
- MQTT state updates whenever relay states change
- Exponential backoff for connection retries
- Unique client ID based on ESP32 MAC address
- MQTT Last Will and Testament for offline detection

**Configuration Options:**
- `RELAY_PINS` - List of GPIO pins connected to relays
- `BUTTON_PINS` - List of GPIO pins connected to momentary switches
- `BUTTON_RELAY_MAP` - Mapping dictionary defining which button controls which relay
- `DEBOUNCE_MS` - Button debounce time in milliseconds (default: `300`)
- `MAX_CONNECTION_RETRIES` - Maximum reconnection attempts before device reset

**How It Works:**
1. Initializes relay outputs and button inputs (with pull-up resistors)
2. Connects to Wi-Fi and MQTT broker with Last Will message
3. Subscribes to command topics for each relay
4. Monitors for MQTT commands to control relays
5. Detects button presses with edge detection and debouncing
6. Toggles corresponding relay state when button is pressed
7. Publishes state changes to MQTT whenever a relay changes
8. Automatically reconnects with exponential backoff if connections drop

### LivingRoomIOT

A comprehensive living room automation system integrating temperature/humidity sensing, multi-relay control, button inputs, and door monitoring. Designed for ESP32-S3-N16R8 but adaptable.

**Features:**
- Combines functionalities of TempSense, LightCont, and BreakSense (for door).
- Wi-Fi and MQTT connectivity with robust reconnection logic (exponential backoff, LWT, unique ID).
- SHT31 temperature and humidity sensing via I2C.
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA) smoothing for sensor data.
- Threshold-based publishing for sensor data to reduce traffic.
- Control for multiple relays via MQTT commands.
- Physical momentary switch control for mapped relays with debouncing.
- Door sensor monitoring (e.g., magnetic reed switch) with debouncing.
- Publishes distinct MQTT topics for sensors, door status, and individual relay states.
- Uses `secrets.py` for sensitive configuration.
- Configurable pins, thresholds, debounce times, and loop delay.
- Automatic device reset after prolonged connection failures.

**Configuration Options (within `LivingRoomIOT.py`):**
- `DEBUG` flag for verbose output.
- I2C pins (`I2C_SCL_PIN`, `I2C_SDA_PIN`), frequency (`I2C_FREQ`), and sensor address (`SENSOR_ADDR`).
- Sensor smoothing (`EMA_ALPHA`) and publishing thresholds (`TEMP_THRESHOLD`, `HUMIDITY_THRESHOLD`).
- GPIO pins for relays (`RELAY_PINS`), buttons (`BUTTON_PINS`), and door sensor (`DOOR_SENSOR_PIN`).
- Debounce times (`BUTTON_DEBOUNCE_MS`, `DOOR_DEBOUNCE_MS`).
- Main loop delay (`LOOP_DELAY`).
- Connection retry limit (`MAX_CONNECTION_RETRIES`).

**MQTT Topics:**
- Sensor Data: `livingroom/temperature_humidity` (JSON payload or ONLINE/OFFLINE)
- Door Status: `livingroom/door` (OPEN/CLOSED)
- Relay Commands: `livingroom/relay/{pin_number}/command` (Subscribes, expects ON/OFF)
- Relay States: `livingroom/relay/{pin_number}/state` (Publishes ON/OFF)

**How It Works:**
1. Initializes hardware: I2C sensor, relays (OFF), buttons (PULL_UP), door sensor (PULL_UP).
2. Connects to Wi-Fi and MQTT broker (with LWT, subscriptions, initial state publishing).
3. Enters main loop:
    a. Checks and attempts reconnection for Wi-Fi and MQTT if needed, using exponential backoff and resetting if max retries exceeded.
    b. Reads sensor, applies EMA, publishes to `livingroom/temperature_humidity` if change exceeds thresholds.
    c. Checks buttons (debounced), toggles corresponding relay, publishes state to `livingroom/relay/{pin}/state`.
    d. Checks door sensor (debounced), publishes state change to `livingroom/door`.
    e. Checks for incoming MQTT messages (relay commands).
    f. Sleeps for `LOOP_DELAY`.

## üîÑ Shared Configuration

All projects use a common `secrets.py` file for sensitive configuration values.

### Required `secrets.py` Content

```python
# Wi-Fi credentials
WIFI_SSID = "your_wifi_ssid"
WIFI_PASSWORD = "your_wifi_password"

# MQTT broker details
MQTT_BROKER = "mqtt.example.com"  # IP address or hostname
MQTT_PORT = 1883                  # Default MQTT port
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. Never commit or share this file.

   ```

2. **Create `secrets.py`**
   - Copy the provided template: `cp secrets_example.py secrets.py`
   - Edit `secrets.py` with your actual credentials
   - See [Shared Configuration](#-shared-configuration) for required values

4. **Upload to ESP32**
   Using tools like `ampy`, `rshell`, or Thonny IDE:
   ```bash
   # Example with ampy for LivingRoomIOT
   ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put secrets.py
   ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put LivingRoomIOT/LivingRoomIOT.py /LivingRoomIOT.py
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

Each project runs independently on an ESP32. After uploading the files, you can:

1. **Start the script**
   ```python
   # On the ESP32 REPL
   import TempSense  # or BreakSense, LightCont, LivingRoomIOT
   ```

2. **For automatic startup**
   Create a `main.py` file on your ESP32:
   ```python
   # Choose which project to run
   import TempSense  # or BreakSense, LightCont, LivingRoomIOT
   ```

3. **Monitoring**
   - Use an MQTT client to subscribe to the respective topics:
     - BreakSense: `esp32/breaksense`
     - TempSense: `esp32/tempsense`
     - LightCont:
       - Individual relay command topics: `esp32/lightcontrol/{pin_number}/command`
       - Individual relay state topics: `esp32/lightcontrol/{pin_number}/state`
     - LivingRoomIOT:
       - Sensor: `livingroom/temperature_humidity`
       - Door: `livingroom/door`
       - Relay Commands: `livingroom/relay/{pin_number}/command`
